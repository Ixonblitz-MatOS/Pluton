# Pluton
C++ Game Engine(Fixed Solarity)
Pluton is a game engine made in C++ based off of a list of youtube tutorials that is planned to be further developed for. 
Solarity was the first attempt at this before Visual Code 2019 has started some issues. This was developed on Visual Studio 2017.

Pluton is planned to be the base game engine for MatOS(Which is in development for better support and created on a better base structure than the previous linux distro). Pluton is more than just a game engine it is just a 3d engine in general but was made in hopes to expand its functionality.

I'd like to give credit to the following:

<li><a href="https://github.com/gabime/spdlog">spdlog</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/premake/premake-core">Premake-Core</a></li>


Compatibility:
<li>Windows 11 X64(Development Platform)</li>
<li>Windows 10 X64(Support)</li>
<li>MatOS X64(Support target platform)<li>
Syntax: TO BE ADDED WITH FURTHER ENGINE DEV

Future plans:
<li>Add Python API support as one of the first 3d engine software that is made for it(There is PyOpenGL but thats graphics not game design)</li>
<li>More built in classes with advanced docs and easier syntax</li>
<li>Spread API to more languages if possible and make it available on Linux and MacOS as well as Windows.</li>
